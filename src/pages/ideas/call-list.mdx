title: "Call List"
---

Essentially, I am trying something new.

If you are reading this, I want to add you to my "Call List", which is very
simply put a list of people that I will call when I go on a walk or instead of
scrolling Instagram/TikTok/YouTube/(insert scrolling app here) or if I just
want to talk to them.

## Some of the reasons I want to do this:

* Spend more time being social
* Connecting more with the people I want to connect with
* I struggle with answering to messages, so this ensures we stay in touch
* Research shows that the physiological response tends to be the better over
  call compared to texting (sometimes even better than video).

## What do you need to do?

You can say no, and all is great, no hard feelings :)

If you do say yes:
				
* You are free not to answer whenever I call you
* If you miss a call, you don't have to call back - you can just text or call
  back if you want Let me know not to call you during certain times (e.g. after
* 10 PM, during work hours, or even just texting me "Please don't call
  tomorrow")
				
## This is weird

If this is weird, which I think it might be to some people, I am doing this
because there used to be this implicit social contract that we are allowed to
just call up a person. We lost this and now randomly calling someone up is
"weird, but not weird". I want to explicitly make it just "not weird".

export const components = {
    h1: ({children, ...props}) => <h1 {...props} className="text-2xl pt-8 font-permanent-marker">{children}</h1>,
    h2: ({children, ...props}) => <h2 {...props} className="text-1xl pt-6 font-permanent-marker">{children}</h2>,
    p: ({children, ...props}) => <p {...props} className="pt-4 text-justify">{children}</p>,
    ol: ({children, ...props}) => <ol {...props} className="pt-2 list-decimal pl-8">{children}</ol>,
    ul: ({children, ...props}) => <ul {...props} className="pt-2 list-disc pl-8">{children}</ul>,
    li: ({children, ...props}) => <li {...props} className="pb-2">{children}</li>,
    a: ({children, ...props}) => <a {...props} className="text-red-500">{children}</a>,
    blockquote: ({children, ...props}) => <blockquote {...props} className="italic my-4 border-l-4 border-neutral-500 pl-2">{children}</blockquote>,
    hr: (props) => <hr {...props} className="h-px bg-neutral-400 border-0 dark:bg-neutral-500" />,
    strong: ({children, ...props}) => <strong {...props} className="font-bold">{children}</strong>
}
