title: "Service Design through Stories"
---

You open Google ready to learn how to create a service and you stare at the
blinking cursor before closing it and moving to something else.

Maybe you type in "How to create a service?", and then stare at the list
of article all titled some variation of "Need to create a service? Start here"
or "10 Best Ways to Create a Service".

Maybe you click some of them (or all of them) and now you have too many options
to pick from.

Or maybe you end up in this training session with me because you are part of
CD's CrocoSchool.

Either way, you are here and it is time we get to know each other a little bit.

My name is Luka, and I will be your trainer for the next two hours. I have been a
CD Member for almost 4 years now and among other things VP Projects of XXXIII
International Board of BEST where together with VP Services I worked on
designing (and implementing) New Hackathon Concept - a project that designed
and piloted a hackathon that any engineering student could participate in. Also,
I have been a trainer for almost two years now with over 100h delivered on
range of topics including Service Design.

In the next two hours I will try to help you set the foundational knowledge so
you can be confident enough to create the next service of BEST instead of being
stuck browsing with unclear direction, risk ending up at a dead end based on a
random choices.

It will be simple:

1. Understand what is Service Design
2. Learn about the fundamental tool for Service Design and see the applications
3. Explore what else is out there and where this fits in the whole idea of
Service Design

How does this sound?

There are some rules:

* We will take breaks when needed, if needed. Two hours is a lot of focus for
  both you and me
* Everything depends on your participation, you cannot just sit back and enjoy
  the show. It will not be easy, and it might be uncomfortable, learning in
  general mostly is uncomfortable, but I will try to make it as easy for you
  as I can

Are you ready to push yourself past that discomfort?

# What is Service Design?

Obviously "Service Design" consists of two words, which are worth exploring
individually.

## Service

What does "Service" actually mean?

If we look at [Merriam Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/service) we will find the following:

> service, noun
> * help, use, benefit
> * contribution to the welfare of others
> * a helpful act
> * useful labor that does not produce a tangible commodity — usually used in plural

But [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/service) hits it perfectly with:

> service, noun
> * an act of helpful activity; help; aid

## Design

As for "Design", [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/design) says:

> design, verb
> * to create, fashion, execute, or construct according to plan : devise, contrive
> * to conceive and plan out in the mind
> * to devise for a specific function or end

***

When put together we can say that service design is

<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-neutral-500 pl-2 pb-4">
    conceiving and planning out in the mind an act of helpful activity
</blockquote>

or in a more natural English

<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-neutral-500 pl-2 pb-4">
    planning out an activity that will help others
</blockquote>

# StoryBrand as a Service Design Foundation

StoryBrand is a marketing framework that helps simplifying a message through
the eyes of storytelling.

What do stories have to do with services? Well, in his book 
[Building a StoryBrand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34460583-building-a-storybrand)
Donald Miller says the following:
> Story is the one thing that can hold a human being’s attention for hours.
>
> Nobody can look away from a good story. In fact, neuroscientists claim the
> average human being spends more than 30 percent of their time daydreaming ...
> unless they’re reading, listening to, or watching a story unfold. Why?
> Because when we are engaged in a story, the story does the daydreaming for us.
>
> Story is the greatest weapon we have to combat noise, because it organizes
> information in such a way that people are compelled to listen.

While that is important, stories have another quality, they make us feel and
empathise. And as we already concluded service is an activity that will **help others**.

StoryBrand framework can guide us part by part to empathize with the people
who are going to use our service and by doing that help us design a service
that will be useful to someone.
