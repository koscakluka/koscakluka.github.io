title: "Service Design through Stories"

You open Google ready to learn how to create a service and you stare at the
blinking cursor before closing it and moving to something else.

Maybe you type in "How to create a service?", and then stare at the list
of article all titled some variation of "Need to create a service? Start here"
or "10 Best Ways to Create a Service".

Maybe you click some of them (or all of them) and now you have too many options
to pick from.

Or maybe you end up in this training session with me because you are part of
CD's CrocoSchool.

Either way, you are here and it is time we get to know each other a little bit.

My name is Luka, and I will be your trainer for the next two hours. I have been a
CD Member for almost 4 years now and among other things VP Projects of XXXIII
International Board of BEST where together with VP Services I worked on
designing (and implementing) New Hackathon Concept - a project that designed
and piloted a hackathon that any engineering student could participate in. Also,
I have been a trainer for almost two years now with over 100h delivered on
range of topics including Service Design.

In the next two hours I will try to help you set the foundational knowledge so
you can be confident enough to create the next service of BEST instead of being
stuck browsing with unclear direction, risk ending up at a dead end based on a
random choices.

It will be simple:

1. Understand what Service Design means
2. Learn about the fundamental tool for Service Design and see the applications
3. Explore what else is out there and where this fits in the whole idea of
Service Design

How does this sound?

There are some rules:

* We will take breaks when needed, if needed. Two hours is a lot of focus for
  both you and me
* Everything depends on your participation, you cannot just sit back and enjoy
  the show. It will not be easy, and it might be uncomfortable, learning in
  general mostly is uncomfortable, but you have to participate 

Are you ready to push yourself past that discomfort?
